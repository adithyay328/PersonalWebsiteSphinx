## About Me
My name's Adithya "Adi" Yerramsetty, and I'm a Sophomore studying Computer Science and Mathematics
at ASU. Apart from classes, I'm the Head of Content at the ML(Machine Learning) Club
at ASU, which I helped restart following its recent restructuring. Last summer, I worked at SVB
as a Machine Learning/Data Science Intern, working on using Network Analysis techniques to predict
future investment oppurtunities given the prior behavior of an investor.

## What you can find here

For the most part, I use this website to share tutorials, and show off
recent projects I've been working on.

### Tutorials
During my time as an officer at the Machine Learning Club, I've been responsible for leading
quite a few lectures and workshops on topics related to Machine Learning. I've found
that, as is supported by a lot of anecdotal evidence from studies on learning,
**teaching others is one of the best ways to learn a topic for yourself.**

To take advantage of this, I'll be putting tutorials on this site that cover topics I find interesting.
Specifically, this include most of computer/robotic perception
and visual SLAM, Machine Learning, Mathematical Optimization and other topics in Software Engineering,
Computer Science and Mathematics.

Hopefully these serve as useful learning materials for anyone who is curious and wants to learn
about these topics.

### Projects
At any point in time, I'm usually working on a couple projects, either for fun, for research 
or to build something useful. This site contains some notes, observations and updates on 
some of these, in case you're interested.
