# Welcome to Adi's Website!

## Who am I
My name's Adithya "Adi" Yerramsetty, and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science and Mathematics
at ASU. Apart from classes, I'm the Head of Content at the ML(Machine Learning) Club
at ASU, which I helped re-start following its recent restructuring.

```{eval-rst}
.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
```
